# begnner-practice-projects

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
This is a repository of all the projects I start learning with. It will probably be very messy as I am not used to any of these tools yet, but hopefully I will get better every day, and soon I will have nice clean code, with sensible commit messages.

--ANIMATED-ROBOT-CSS--
This project came from Andrei Neagoie's Web developer 2018 Zero to Mastery course. The goal was simply to align the robot in the center of the screen, fully assembled. My solution is imperfect, and somewhat inelegant, but functional.
